# Linked-List

This code defines a Java class called LinkedList that represents a singly linked list data structure.

The LinkedList class has three instance variables: head, which is a reference to the first node in the list; count, which is an integer that keeps track of the number of nodes in the list; and data, which is an object that stores the data associated with the node.

The LinkedList class has four methods:

add(Object data): This method creates a new Node object with the given data and adds it to the front of the list. It updates the head and count instance variables to reflect the addition of the new node.

pop(): This method removes the first node from the list. It updates the head and count instance variables to reflect the removal of the node.

reverse(): This method reverses the order of the nodes in the list.

show(): This method traverses the list and prints the data of each node in the list.
